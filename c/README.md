# Text-to-Speech (TTS)
## C

Creating a full-fledged text-to-speech (TTS) program from scratch in C is a complex task that typically involves using external libraries and APIs, as well as knowledge of audio processing and synthesis. However, I have provide a simplified example of a basic TTS program in C using the `espeak` library, which is a compact open-source TTS engine that can be used for simple text-to-speech tasks.

Before proceeding, make sure you have `espeak` installed on your system. You can install it using your system's package manager (e.g., `apt-get` on Ubuntu or `brew` on macOS).

Here's a simple example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <espeak/speak_lib.h>

int main()
{
    if (espeak_Initialize(AUDIO_OUTPUT_PLAYBACK, 0, NULL, 0) < 0)
    {
        printf("Failed to initialize eSpeak.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    const char *text = "Hello, this is a simple text-to-speech example in C.";
    espeak_Synth(text, strlen(text) + 1, 0, POS_CHARACTER, 0, espeakCHARS_AUTO, NULL, NULL);
    espeak_Synchronize();

    espeak_Terminate();

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

1. We include the necessary headers for working with `espeak`.
2. We initialize the `espeak` engine using `espeak_Initialize()`. The `AUDIO_OUTPUT_PLAYBACK` argument specifies the audio output type.
3. We provide a text message to be converted to speech in the `text` variable.
4. We use `espeak_Synth()` to synthesize the speech from the text.
5. Finally, we clean up and terminate the `espeak` engine using `espeak_Terminate()`.

Compile and run the program using a C compiler:

```bash
gcc tts_example.c -o tts_example -lespeak
./tts_example
```

This is a very basic example and doesn't cover more advanced features of TTS systems. For more advanced TTS capabilities, you might consider using more feature-rich libraries or cloud-based TTS APIs like Google Cloud Text-to-Speech, Amazon Polly, or Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services Text to Speech, which provide more natural-sounding and customizable speech synthesis.
