# Text-to-Speech (TTS)
## GO

Sure, I can provide you with a simple example of a text-to-speech program in Go using the "github.com/go-ego/tts" library. Before you proceed, make sure you have the library installed. You can install it using:

```bash
go get github.com/go-ego/tts
```

Here's the equivalent program in Go:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
    "github.com/go-ego/tts"
)

func main() {
    // Create a TTS instance
    speaker := tts.New()
    
    // Initialize the TTS engine
    err := speaker.Init(tts.Espeak)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Printf("Failed to initialize TTS: %v\n", err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }
    
    // Text to be converted to speech
    text := "Hello, this is a simple text-to-speech example in Go."
    
    // Synthesize and play the speech
    err = speaker.Speak(text)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Printf("Failed to speak text: %v\n", err)
    }
    
    // Close the TTS engine
    speaker.Close()
}
```

In this Go example:

1. We import the necessary packages, including the "github.com/go-ego/tts" package.
2. We create a TTS instance using `tts.New()`.
3. We initialize the TTS engine with the "Espeak" backend using `speaker.Init(tts.Espeak)`.
4. We provide the text message to be converted to speech in the `text` variable.
5. We use `speaker.Speak()` to synthesize and play the speech.
6. Finally, we close the TTS engine using `speaker.Close()`.

Compile and run the program:

```bash
go run tts_example.go
```

This Go example provides a basic TTS functionality using the "github.com/go-ego/tts" library. For more advanced text-to-speech capabilities, you may want to explore other TTS libraries or cloud-based TTS services available for Go.
